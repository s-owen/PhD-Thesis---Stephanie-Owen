\begin{acknowledgements}      


And I would like to acknowledge Sarwah, Tedi, Ania, Maria and Carolin along with the rest of the Brenton lab for their academic support with this thesis and being open to discuss ideas and help this ex-physicist get lab work done. I would also like to thank Luke, without whom this whole thing would have been vastly more difficult, who has always been there for me, made me many cups of tea and sacrificed his own time to support me, especially during the last months of this journey.
